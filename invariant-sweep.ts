/**
 * The E2E invariant sweep testing.md asks of every visited page, as a Playwright
 * fixture a repo imports instead of `@playwright/test`'s own `test`:
 *
 *   no page logged a `console.error`, no page threw, and no page scrolled
 *   sideways.
 *
 * They are invariants rather than assertions because no single test owns them.
 * A flow test knows what it came to click; nobody's job is to notice that the
 * checkout page has been logging a failed request for three weeks, or that a
 * card runs eight pixels past the right edge on a phone. Written as assertions
 * they would have to be repeated in every spec and would be missing from the
 * one that mattered — so they are a property of *visiting a page at all*, and
 * the only thing a repo does to get them is change one import.
 *
 * ## Where the checking happens, and why it is not in the test process
 *
 * The console and the page's own errors arrive as events, so those are the easy
 * half. Overflow is a measurement, and a measurement has to happen somewhere,
 * at some moment. Two designs that do not work:
 *
 * - **After each `goto`.** A test that navigates by clicking a link never calls
 *   `goto`, and those pages would go unswept while the fixture claimed to sweep
 *   every one.
 * - **On the runner's `load` event.** The check is an `evaluate`, so it races
 *   the test: a spec that navigates again immediately destroys the execution
 *   context mid-measurement, and the honest handling of that rejection is to
 *   swallow it — which turns "every page" into "every page the spec was slow
 *   enough to let us look at", silently.
 *
 * So the measuring runs **in the page**, installed by an init script that runs
 * in every document before anything else, and reports back through an exposed
 * binding. There is no context to lose and no navigation to race, and an SPA
 * route change that never fires `load` is caught by the same observer as
 * everything else.
 *
 * ## The fixture is the context, not the page
 *
 * Everything is installed on the browser **context**, so a page the spec never
 * held a reference to — a `target="_blank"` popup, an OAuth window — is swept
 * like any other. A `page` fixture cannot see those at all: they are pages the
 * context opened and the spec may never name.
 *
 * ## What the page is allowed to say about itself
 *
 * A page is not a trusted narrator. The bridge takes **one string** from it and
 * nothing else: the `kind` is always `overflow`, and the URL is the one
 * Playwright says that frame is at. Reports from anything but the top frame are
 * dropped, so a cross-origin iframe cannot invent a violation for the page
 * carrying it, and the string itself is stripped of control characters — which
 * is what stops an embed writing ANSI escapes or a `::error::` workflow command
 * into somebody's CI annotation.
 *
 * The same reasoning decides which URL a console error is attributed to. The
 * console reports the script's URL, and a script's URL is whatever its
 * `//# sourceURL=` comment claims — so an inline script of ours can wear a
 * vendor's name and land in the vendor's allowlist bucket. A claimed URL is
 * therefore honoured only when a document or script **actually loaded** from it
 * in this page, which is a fact about responses the browser received and not
 * one any page can write.
