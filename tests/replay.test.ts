/**
 * A real Postgres, because the property under test is what a database ends up
 * holding: an upgrade that reaches a different schema from a rebuild is a fact
 * about two databases, and nothing short of two of them can report it. PGlite
 * cannot stand in — the gate builds the upgrade path in a second database on
 * the same server, and PGlite has no second database.
 *
 * Every repo in the suite is a real git repository with a real migrator, so
 * what the gate reads is a history and a lineage rather than a description of
 * one. Nothing here clears the database the gate builds between cases: the gate
 * drops it, and a suite that tidied up after it would be the reason nobody
 * noticed it had stopped.
 *
 * Every name this suite puts on the server carries the process it came from, and
 * the gate's own carries the checkout it is replaying — so a second run of this
 * suite against the same Postgres, which is what two worktrees under review
 * produce, shares nothing with the first.
