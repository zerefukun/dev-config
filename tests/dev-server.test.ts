/**
 * The dev-server CLI, against real git worktrees and real detached processes.
 *
 * Real time is spent here on purpose and it is the one suite in this repo that
 * has to: what is being graded is a child process reaching a listening socket, a
 * signal reaching a process group, and two invocations racing each other, none
 * of which any injected clock has a part in. Every wait is bounded by
 * `DEV_SERVER_READY_TIMEOUT_MS`, which the fixture sets on every invocation —
 * twenty seconds where a server is meant to come up, two where the case is about
 * one that never does.
