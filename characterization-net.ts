/**
 * The harness a golden — characterization — net is built on, and the rules that
 * keep one honest once it is large enough that nobody reads all of it.
 *
 * The testing canon already asks for golden oracles built from real captured
 * payloads. This is the layer under that: at a few thousand fixtures a net stops
 * failing by being wrong and starts failing by being *believed* — a re-baseline
 * that blessed a regression, a shard that crashed and read as green, a golden
 * compared against bytes that no longer resemble what the normaliser emits. Each
 * rule below closes one of those, and the ones that are structural are closed by
 * the shape of `Net` rather than by a check:
 *
 * 1. **One build path for asserting and for re-baselining.** There is one
 *    `capture` and one `normalize`, and both operations call them. The classic
 *    bug — goldens updated through a different request-build than they are
 *    compared with — is not something this refuses; it is something it cannot
 *    express.
 * 2. **The committed golden is re-normalised before comparison**, never trusted
 *    to still be byte-identical to what today's normaliser would emit. A net
 *    that compares raw bytes turns every normaliser change into a thousand-file
 *    re-baseline, which is the diff nobody reads.
 * 3. **A golden is written only when it changed.** A re-baseline's diff is then
 *    exactly the behaviour delta, which is the only thing that makes reviewing
 *    golden diffs like code possible.
 * 4. **Changing an existing golden needs a blessing.** Creating one does not: a
 *    new case has no behaviour to regress. Overwriting one does, and a
 *    re-baseline run that cannot say what it is blessing is a re-baseline nobody
 *    decided to do.
 * 5. **Status is part of the golden**, in the type, from day 0. A sidecar
 *    mechanism for it is accretive, and an accretive mechanism covers whatever
 *    fraction of the net somebody got round to.
 * 6. **Sharding is a pure function** of the case list and the shard count, so a
 *    run at any parallelism — including one shard — covers exactly the same
 *    cases in the same order.
 * 7. **Orphans fail.** A golden file no case claims is a case that was deleted
 *    and a fixture that was not, and it will sit there being green forever.
 * 8. **Every run answers with a summary line.** A shard that died wrote no
 *    report at all, and a driver that asserts the summary of each shard is what
 *    stops that reading as a pass. The driver is the repo's, because how it
 *    shards is; docs/exports/characterization-net.md carries the shape, along
 *    with the outbound-golden rule this module deliberately does not implement.
