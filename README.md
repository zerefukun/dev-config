# @zerefukun/dev-config

One source of truth for the tooling policy shared by my Bun projects: TypeScript
strictness, the oxlint rule set including its type-aware rules, the architecture
boundaries wiring, the formatter width, the workspace-agnostic knip settings, the
Renovate policy, the coverage floor, the secret-scanning gate, the stack
denylist, the contract a repo declares about itself, and the CI workflow every
repo calls.

Repos install it straight from GitHub — no registry, no build step, the files are
consumed exactly as they are committed:

```sh
bun add -d github:zerefukun/dev-config \
  typescript oxlint oxlint-tsgolint oxfmt knip \
  eslint-plugin-boundaries eslint-import-resolver-typescript
```

The tools are peer dependencies, all optional: a repo installs the ones it uses.
`oxlint-tsgolint` is not optional in practice — without it `oxlint` skips every
type-aware rule (see below).

Consuming repos keep only their own facts locally (paths, JSX, globals, entry
points, ignore globs, the layer matrix) and inherit everything else. If a repo has
to override a shared setting, the override carries a comment naming the reason.

| File                           | Consumed by    | How                                        |

| `.github/actions/*/action.yml` | GitHub Actions | `uses` by repository path, pinned to a SHA |

Each gate has a reference page of its own. This file holds the map and the
settings every repo shares; what a single gate asserts, and why, lives beside it:

Beside the gates CI runs are the modules a consuming repo **imports**. A gate
refuses a tree from the outside; an export is code the repo calls, and it is the
shape a rule takes when what it grades is only visible from inside the repo — an
app's own route table, its own limiter, its own browser. Each is in `files` and
`exports`, and each has a page of its own:

| Export                                                            | Imported by                    | What it holds                                                          |

| [`invariant-sweep.ts`](docs/exports/invariant-sweep.md)           | the Playwright specs           | zero console errors and no sideways scroll, on every page a test opens |

| [`characterization-net.ts`](docs/exports/characterization-net.md) | a golden suite and its updater | the harness rules that keep a large golden net honest                  |

Gate code is deliberately **not** importable by the repos it gates — a gate in
`node_modules` runs only if the repo's workflow remembers to, and it moves
whenever the lockfile does. Anything a repo calls directly is one of these
instead.

## TypeScript

`tsconfig.base.json` resolves through Node module resolution, so it is referenced
by package name:

```json
{
  "extends": "@zerefukun/dev-config/tsconfig.base.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "jsx": "react-jsx",
    "lib": ["ES2023", "DOM", "DOM.Iterable"],
    "types": ["vite/client", "bun"],
    "paths": { "~/*": ["./src/*"] }
  },
  "include": ["src"]
}
```

`paths` stands on its own — TypeScript 7 removed `baseUrl`, and a config that
still sets it fails the build.

The base targets ES2023 with `module: "preserve"` + `moduleResolution: "bundler"`
— the pairing TypeScript 7 expects when a bundler (Vite, Bun) owns the emit — and
turns on:

- `strict`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`
- `noImplicitOverride`, `noImplicitReturns`, `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch`
- `noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature` — index-signature reads use `obj["key"]`,
  so a typo in a dotted read stays a type error instead of silently widening
- `noUncheckedSideEffectImports` — a bare `import "./thing"` must resolve
- `allowUnreachableCode: false`, `allowUnusedLabels: false`
- `verbatimModuleSyntax`, `isolatedModules`, `erasableSyntaxOnly` — enums,
  parameter properties and namespaces are errors, because Bun and Vite strip
  types rather than compile them

`noUnusedLocals` and `noUnusedParameters` are deliberately absent: unused code is
the linter's report to make, and having both tools flag it means every dead
binding is two diagnostics with two different suppression syntaxes.

`skipLibCheck` is on: the dependency trees here are large and third-party `.d.ts`
noise is not this project's bug to fix.

## oxlint

`.oxlintrc.json` cannot resolve package names — its `extends` entries are paths
relative to the config file — so the base is referenced through `node_modules`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oxc-project/oxc/main/npm/oxlint/configuration_schema.json",
  "extends": ["./node_modules/@zerefukun/dev-config/oxlint.base.json"],
  "env": { "browser": true, "node": true, "es2024": true },
  "ignorePatterns": ["node_modules/**", "dist/**"]
}
```

Configs merge first-to-last, so anything the local file declares wins over the
base.

The base sets `correctness: error`, `suspicious: error`, `perf: warn`,
`no-console: warn`, and the hooks rules — which oxlint configures under the
`react` plugin as `react/rules-of-hooks` and `react/exhaustive-deps`. Their
diagnostics are labelled `react-hooks`, but there is no `react-hooks` plugin to
name in a config, and a config naming one silently lints nothing.

`suspicious` denies rather than warns because every repo here is template-born
and greenfield: there is no inherited violation count for a warn tier to report
on, so it would only be a list nobody is required to drive to zero. A rule in
that tier which is genuinely wrong for a repo becomes a disable carrying its
reason, or an `overrides` entry — both visible, and both expiring the moment the
finding does.

**`warn` is advisory and cannot fail a build.** `oxlint` exits 0 with warnings
outstanding, and no `--max-warnings` is passed anywhere in this repo's CI. So the
deny tier is the gate and the warn tier is a report: a rule that has to hold goes
to `error`, and a rule at `warn` is a hint whose count nobody is required to
drive to zero. Moving something from `warn` to `error` is the whole of the
decision — there is no middle setting that stops a merge.

A config's own `plugins` array replaces oxlint's built-in defaults rather than
adding to them, which is why the base names every plugin it wants including the
defaults `oxc`, `unicorn` and `typescript`. Across `extends` the arrays are
unioned, so a repo that adds `plugins` of its own keeps the base's.

Four rules the base switches off: `no-await-in-loop` (a sequential loop is
usually the correct one here, and the fan-out it asks for is a design call about
shared state the rule cannot see), `react/react-in-jsx-scope` (the automatic JSX
runtime imports nothing), `oxc/no-map-spread` (its advice is to mutate in place,
wrong for the copy-on-write style these codebases are written in), and
`unicorn/consistent-function-scoping`, in the test-file override alone (a helper
one describe uses belongs inside it). The reason in full sits beside each entry,
which is where the repo contract requires it — see
[the repo contract](docs/gates/repo-contract.md).

### The escape hatches, and their price

Every way of telling the compiler or the linter to look away is denied, because
each one converts a question into silence:

- `typescript/no-explicit-any` — `unknown` forces the narrowing that `any`
  skips, and the unsafe-`any` family below only fires on values that are already
  `any`.
- `typescript/no-non-null-assertion` — `!` asserts an invariant to the compiler
  and to no one else. `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` is on, so array and record reads
  are the common case: handle the `undefined` or prove it away with a check.
- `typescript/ban-ts-comment` — `@ts-ignore` and `@ts-nocheck` are out;
  `@ts-expect-error` is allowed with a description of at least 12 characters,
  which is long enough that a real reason fits and `// @ts-expect-error fix` does
  not.
- `no-empty` — an empty block is either a swallowed failure or a deliberate
  no-op, and only one of those is defensible. A comment inside the block
  satisfies the rule, so an intentionally empty `catch` says what it is
  intentionally ignoring.
- `unicorn/no-abusive-eslint-disable` — a bare `oxlint-disable` with no rule
  named turns off everything on that line, including the rules nobody has written
  yet.
- `eslint/no-warning-comments` — `TODO`, `FIXME`, `XXX` and `HACK` anywhere in a
  comment. The register is GitHub issues in the repo the work belongs to; a
  marker in a file is invisible to anyone who is not already reading that file.
- `typescript/no-restricted-types` — `Record<string, unknown>` and
  `Record<string, any>`. The bag with no keys is how a shape nobody modelled
  travels: it type-checks everywhere and asserts nothing. It is legal exactly
  once per boundary, as a **named alias at the module that owns that boundary**,
  carrying one disable with the why — `type ConfigObject = Record<string,
unknown>` in `_lib/gate.ts` here, for config files this repo reads and does
  not own. Everything else is one of: model the shape, parse the input, or
  delete the cast. A fleet-wide escape alias re-exported everywhere is the one
  thing this must not become; the linter cannot see the difference, so review
  does. Inline `{ [k: string]: unknown }` is not matched — the rule reads type
  references, not shapes — but `anti-slop/no-unsafe-dictionary-type` below is,
  and catches it along with aliases and mapped types.
- `no-restricted-globals` — `__dirname`, `__filename` and `require`. Every repo
  here is ESM, where none of the three exists; the entries name the replacement
  (`import.meta.dir`, `import.meta.url`, `import`) so the diagnostic is the fix.

### Overrides

Two facts are true of a file because of where it sits, not what it contains:

```json
{
  "overrides": [
    {
      "files": ["**/*.test.ts", "**/*.test.tsx", "**/*.spec.ts", "**/*.spec.tsx"],
      "rules": {
        "unicorn/consistent-function-scoping": "off",
        "anti-slop/no-call-log-assertions": "error",
        "anti-slop/no-local-module-mocks": "error",
        "anti-slop/no-mock-assertions": "error",
        "anti-slop/no-real-timers": "error"
      }
    },
    { "files": ["src/server/**", "server/**", "apps/api/**"], "rules": { "no-console": "error" } }
  ]
}
```

A test file is where the four scoped rules of [the plugin](#the-anti-slop-plugin)
apply, and where a helper one `describe` uses belongs inside it rather than
hoisted to module scope. And server code writes through the structured logger, so
`no-console` rises from `warn` to `error` on the server globs — a one-shot CLI
under those paths carries a file-level disable with its reason, which is the shape
the directive rule below already requires.

**An override replaces a rule's whole configuration; it does not add to it**
(oxc#12179). An override that says nothing about a rule inherits it whole, so the
cost lands only where one is redefined: an override restating a list-shaped rule
to change a single thing about it silently exempts every file it matches from
every entry it did not restate, in every repo extending the base. Nothing here
redefines one today, and `tests/oxlint-base.test.ts` is what keeps that honest —
it proves the semantics against a config it builds itself, and holds any override
that does redefine one to carrying every entry the top level states.

`overrides` survive `extends`, so a consuming repo inherits both without naming
them.

### Locking a settled decision

A stack decision that has been made — this driver, not that one; this call, not
the property that silently does the wrong thing — is worth exactly as much as
the next person's memory of it. So it goes in the repo's own `.oxlintrc.json` as
a `no-restricted-properties`, `no-restricted-imports` or `no-restricted-globals`
entry whose message says **why it is settled** and **where the choke point is**:
not "don't use X" but "use `mysqlAffectedRows()` from `~/lib/db-result` — reading
`.affectedRows` off the wrapped object silently yields 0". Violations that
predate the lock go in a per-file `overrides` whitelist, so a new one fails
immediately while the old ones drain, and the whitelist going empty is what
deletes the block — a ratchet, tracked by an issue, not a permanent carve-out.
The reference example for the choke messages is nfp-elysia's `.oxlintrc.json`.

These rules are **per-repo and never go in the base**: a decision that is settled
for one repo's stack is not settled for another's, and a base that carried them
would be answering a question nobody in the consuming repo asked.

### Architecture rules

`max-lines` denies at 1000: a file crossing 1000 lines is a presumptive blocker,
and the linter is where that gets said out loud. `max-depth` (4) and `complexity`
(20) warn at oxlint's own defaults, pinned so an upstream default change cannot
move the gate. `import/no-cycle` denies.

### Type-aware rules

`options.typeAware` is set in the base and survives `extends`, so a consuming
repo gets type-aware linting from `oxlint` with no flag and no local config. The
analysis runs in `oxlint-tsgolint`; without that package installed, oxlint runs
and reports nothing from the rules below.

Denied: `typescript/no-floating-promises`, `typescript/no-misused-promises`,
`typescript/await-thenable`, `typescript/no-unnecessary-condition`,
`typescript/switch-exhaustiveness-check`,
`typescript/no-unnecessary-type-assertion`, and the unsafe-`any` family —
`no-unsafe-argument`, `no-unsafe-assignment`, `no-unsafe-call`,
`no-unsafe-enum-comparison`, `no-unsafe-member-access`, `no-unsafe-return`.
Warned: `typescript/prefer-nullish-coalescing`.

`no-unnecessary-condition` fires on any check TypeScript already proved
redundant, which includes real validation at a trust boundary — a parsed JSON
body, a `process.env` read, a value crossing the FFI edge — where the declared
type is a promise the runtime has not made. Those get a targeted disable carrying
the reason:

```ts
// oxlint-disable-next-line typescript/no-unnecessary-condition -- typed from the schema, arrives unvalidated over the wire
if (payload.items) {
```

A disable without a reason is a suppressed bug, and the `suppression-hygiene`
action fails a run over one. The directive has to be one line — a wrapped second
comment line becomes the "next line" and the suppression misses.

The lint script also passes
`--report-unused-disable-directives-severity=error`, which turns a directive that
no longer suppresses anything into a failure. Without it, a disable outlives the
finding it was written for and quietly widens: the rule it names stops applying
to that line for the next person who writes there.

Type-aware rules need resolved types, so a repo whose types come from generated
code runs its codegen before linting, exactly as it does before `tsc`.

### The anti-slop plugin

Type-aware rules catch what `any` touches; they do not see a plain `as`. So
`admin as User as object`, an `unknown` parameter that never gets parsed, a
function that hands `unknown` back, and a `Record<string, unknown>` value
contract all pass a fully type-aware run — and assertion laundering is precisely
the move an agent makes to silence the rules above. Eleven rules close that,
shipped in this package as an oxlint JS plugin and enabled at `error` by the
base:

| Rule                         | What it rejects                                                        |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `no-chained-type-assertions` | `x as object as User` — nested assertions that fabricate evidence      |
| `no-known-value-widening`    | a broad annotation over a known initializer; use `satisfies`           |
| `no-unsafe-dictionary-type`  | dictionary contracts whose value type is `unknown`/`any`/`object`/`{}` |
| `no-unknown-type-aliases`    | an alias that only renames `unknown`                                   |
| `no-object-parameters`       | the broad `object` type on an input                                    |
| `no-unknown-parameters`      | an `unknown` parameter, except the `cause` convention                  |
| `no-unknown-returns`         | a declared return of `unknown` or `Promise<unknown>`                   |
| `no-reflect-apply`           | `Reflect.apply`, which launders past a typed call                      |
| `no-reflect-get`             | `Reflect.get`, which answers `any` for a property read                 |

Where a ported rule overlapped oxlint's own `typescript/no-unsafe-type-assertion`
— which the base denies through `suspicious` — both were run over the same
fixtures and only the stronger one kept.

`no-chained-type-assertions` is the one that overlaps and stays. The native
rule covers every chain that fabricates a type, because such a chain has a
narrowing link in it for the checker to refuse. A chain whose every link widens
has none: `admin as User as object` draws nothing from the native rule, nothing
from `no-unnecessary-type-assertion`, and nothing else in the base says the type
it started from was discarded. Widening a binding and asserting it back needs no
rule of its own — that is an assertion to a narrower type by construction, which
is the whole of what the native rule reads, and `oxlint-base.test.ts` grades the
base on those shapes directly.

Four more are enabled only over `*.test.ts`, `*.test.tsx`, `*.spec.ts` and
`*.spec.tsx`, because every one of them is ordinary code anywhere else: a source
file counts calls, sleeps, reaches into a module of its own and hands a function
to `expect` in a helper, and none of that is a smell until it is a test's whole
evidence.

| Rule                     | What it rejects                                                                                      |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `no-call-log-assertions` | `toHaveBeenCalled*` on an `expect()` chain — that it was called, how often, in what order, with what |
| `no-mock-assertions`     | `expect()` on a stand-in, or on anything read through one                                            |
| `no-local-module-mocks`  | `mock.module()` or `spyOn()` over a relative import                                                  |
| `no-real-timers`         | the timer globals, `Bun.sleep`, and the `node:timers` modules                                        |

What they have in common is that each of them passes against an implementation
nobody would ship. A call log grades the collaborator calls an implementation
happens to make and stays green when it never uses what it got back; a stand-in
is the test's own object, so an assertion about it is about what the test
already did; a fake over a module in this repo grades the fake rather than the
module, and the real one is right there to call; and a suite that waits for real
time is slow in proportion to how much of it it waits for and flaky in
proportion to how loaded the runner is.

All four recognise their subject **through the import**, never through the name
written at the call site. `import { mock as m }`, `import * as bt from
"bun:test"`, `import bt from "bun:test"` — a default import is the same object
under Bun's CJS interop — and vitest's or jest's spelling of the same call are
one rule and one diagnostic. A gate keyed to the written name is a gate an `as`
turns off, which is a one-token edit that reads as style. `bun:test`, `vitest`
and `@jest/globals` are the modules; `jest` and `vi` are also read as globals,
because two of the three runners inject them.

Two boundaries are worth stating, because both rules are wrong without them.
`no-mock-assertions` asks what the subject of the assertion is _reached
through_: every way of reading a call log by hand — `.mock.calls.length`,
`.mock.calls[0]`, `.mock.calls.at(0)`, `.mock.lastCall` — is one spelling of
reaching through a stand-in, and a rule that matched chains would be one
spelling behind forever. Calling the stand-in is the other side of that line:
`expect(send())` is what the code under test would have got, which is the one
thing about a stand-in worth asserting on, and an object of the test's own with
a `mock` property on it is not a stand-in at all. For `no-local-module-mocks`
the line is the specifier: a package is a true external boundary, so
`mock.module("stripe", …)` is not what that rule is about.

#### What they do not see

A plugin reads one file at a time and has no type checker under it. Two
boundaries follow from that, and everything below is an instance of one of them
— written out because an undocumented limit is one people find by shipping past
it.

**Nothing crosses a module boundary.** A stand-in these rules recognise is one
whose import they can read in the file asserting on it. `export const send =
mock(…)` in a shared test-utils module, a local barrel that re-exports
`{ mock } from "bun:test"`, and `await import("bun:test")` all put the runner or
the stand-in on the far side of a boundary one file cannot see across. This is
the realistic gap: a suite that keeps its stand-ins in a helper gets none of
`no-mock-assertions`, and its call-log matchers are what is left holding the
line — which is why `toHaveBeenCalled` and `toHaveBeenCalledWith` are in the set
rather than only the counts.

**Every reach is one binding deep.** A name is followed to the `const` that gave
it its value, once, and a container is read at the slot written in the literal.
One step further in any direction and the answer is nothing: a nested literal
(`spies.deps.send`), a container behind a call (`Object.freeze({…})`) or a
factory's return value, a slot filled after the declaration, a `Map`, a second
name for the same container, or the call log itself lifted out
(`const log = send.mock`). The same limit is why `const { sleep } = Bun`,
`const later = setTimeout` and a namespace import of `node:timers` are past
`no-real-timers`, while the globals themselves — under all four of their names,
`globalThis`, `self`, `window`, `global` — and a named import of one are
refused.

Where a slot's final value is not the one written at the declaration, the reach
stops rather than guesses. A spread, a computed or repeated key, a getter, or
anything writing through the container (`spies.send = real`) all make the
literal a poor witness, and a rule that read it anyway would report a stand-in
that is not there by the time the assertion runs.

**A matcher computed from a value** has no name to read: `expect(x)[matcher](1)`
is left alone, while `expect(x)["toHaveBeenCalledTimes"](1)` has one and is
refused.

The one place a rule refuses rather than shrugs is a module specifier it cannot
read: `mock.module(import.meta.resolve("./x.ts"))` fails asking to be written as
a string, because "cannot tell one of ours from a package" is not a reason to
allow it.

One line can be two smells: `expect(send).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)` is both a
stand-in handed to `expect` and a call log asserted on, and it reports twice. A
directive names rules one at a time, so the escape from both is both names in
one — `oxlint-disable-next-line anti-slop/no-mock-assertions,
anti-slop/no-call-log-assertions -- <reason>`. As everywhere else here, the
reason is not optional; the suppression-hygiene gate holds every directive to
carrying one.

Ported from [dmmulroy/anti-slop](https://github.com/dmmulroy/anti-slop) (MIT);
`anti-slop/index.js` names the upstream commit this port is level with, because
that file is the one a consuming repo can read. Upstream vendors the rules into each repo; they live here
because oxlint's `jsPlugins` API is alpha and explicitly outside semver, so the
rule code and the oxlint version have to move as one pin — which is what the
release pair already does. `no-conditional-empty-object-spread` is deliberately not ported: with
`exactOptionalPropertyTypes` the conditional spread is the only type-legal way
to conditionally include a field in an option bag you do not own. Two more are
not ported either: `require-safety-comment-for-type-assertion`, whose goal the
native rule and the reason-carrying disable already deliver in a form that is
counted and checked rather than syntactic, and `no-module-mocking`, which knows
`vi` and `jest` but not `bun:test` — `no-local-module-mocks` below covers all
three runners, and refuses a stand-in over a module of ours rather than over a
package, which is where a fake belongs.

Upstream's opt-in Effect rule, `no-service-constructor-imports`, was evaluated
and declined: it keys on a `make<Capability>` naming convention, and a
convention settled for one repo's stack is not a base rule — the same reason
the choke rules above stay per-repo. There is nowhere else for it to go
either. The base enables every rule this plugin defines, and the suite requires
those two sets to be equal, so the plugin has no opt-in half to put it in.

One rule answers differently from upstream, because a rule at `error` across
the fleet must refuse something the author can change:

- **`no-known-value-widening`** does not call an anonymous object type a
  widening when it names exactly the keys of the literal below it. Upstream
  does, and its only escapes are deleting the return type or inventing a name
  for it — the opposite of what this repo asks for everywhere else.

Two facts about how it is wired, both load-bearing:

- **The `jsPlugins` specifier is relative to `oxlint.base.json`**, so a repo that
  extends the base through `node_modules` resolves the plugin with no line of its
  own. There is nothing to scaffold per repo.
- **The plugin is JavaScript, not TypeScript.** Node refuses to strip types from
  any file under `node_modules` (`ERR_UNSUPPORTED_NODE_MODULES_TYPE_STRIPPING`),
  and this directory is inside `node_modules` for every repo that consumes it.
  `tsc` still checks it in this repo, through `checkJs` and JSDoc types.

`tests/anti-slop.test.ts` drives the nine with the real binary: a block of cases
per rule — alias chains, shadowed built-ins, type parameters bound by default,
permuted between two aliases and named for the aliases they shadow, the scope a
binding resolves in, and the clean tree each of those has to leave alone — plus
upstream's own fixtures for the six rules it ships tests for, run as a
differential oracle against this port. It also asks the plugin and the base for
their rule names and requires them to match: a rule the base does not enable is
a rule no repo runs, and a name in the base the plugin does not define is a rule
nobody notices is missing.

`tests/anti-slop-test-smells.test.ts` is the other four, which have a second
question to answer about every case — the base has to catch them in a
`.test.ts`, a `.spec.ts` and both `.tsx` spellings, and to say nothing about the
same source in a `.ts` or a `.tsx`, since a rule that fired everywhere is one
every repo would turn off. Most of its cases are the spellings that would
otherwise turn a rule off: an `as` on an import, a namespace, an optional link,
a global reached through `globalThis`, a matcher in brackets.

The harness in `tests/lint-fixture.ts` carries cases of its own, because a
plugin that throws and a config oxlint refuses both produce a run with no
diagnostics — which is exactly what a clean-tree case asserts.

### What the linter cannot see

oxlint ships `jest` and `vitest` rule sets, and none of them fire on a `bun test`
suite: they key off imports from `jest`/`vitest`, and these repos import from
`bun:test`. Turning them on produces a config that reports nothing and looks like
coverage.

So the properties those rules would have checked — that a test asserted
something, that nothing was skipped — are enforced by the JUnit greps in the
`test-suite` action instead, on the report of a run that actually happened. That
is the correct layer and the only one available: do not "improve" the gate by
moving it into the linter.

## Architecture boundaries

`eslint-plugin-boundaries` runs under oxlint's JS-plugin support. The element and
layer matrix is a per-repo fact and lives in `.oxlintrc.json`:

```json
{
  "jsPlugins": ["eslint-plugin-boundaries"],
  "settings": {
    "import/resolver": { "typescript": { "project": "./tsconfig.json" } },
    "boundaries/elements": [
      { "type": "domain", "pattern": "src/domain" },
      { "type": "http", "pattern": "src/http" }
    ]
  },
  "rules": {
    "boundaries/no-unknown-dependencies": "error",
    "boundaries/dependencies": [
      "error",
      {
        "default": "allow",
        "policies": [
          {
            "from": { "element": { "type": "domain" } },
            "disallow": [{ "to": { "element": { "type": "http" } } }],
            "message": "domain must not import http"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Both settings keys are load-bearing:

- `import/resolver` is what turns an import specifier into a file path. Without
  it only specifiers carrying an explicit extension resolve; extensionless and
  `~/`-aliased imports resolve to nothing and every violation through them passes
  silently.
- `boundaries/no-unknown-dependencies` turns an unresolved import into an error,
  so a resolver that stops working announces itself instead of quietly disabling
  the layer matrix.

An element `pattern` names a folder, not a file glob: `src/domain` classifies
everything under it, while `src/domain/*.ts` matches nothing and leaves the files
unclassified.

## Formatting

`oxfmt` has no `extends`, so the config is copied into each repo as
`.oxfmtrc.json`:

```json
{ "printWidth": 100 }
```

100 is also oxfmt's default; writing it down pins the width against a default
that could move.

## knip

Only a TypeScript or JavaScript knip config can import from a package, so repos
use `knip.ts` rather than `knip.json`:

```ts
import type { KnipConfig } from "knip";
import { base } from "@zerefukun/dev-config/knip.base.ts";

const config: KnipConfig = {
  ...base,
  entry: ["src/router.tsx", "src/routes/**/*.tsx"],
  project: ["src/**/*.{ts,tsx}"],
};

export default config;
```

Everything knip keys off file paths stays local — a base glob that matches
nothing in the consuming repo is itself reported as a configuration hint.

The base also exports `mutationLaneDependencies`, the two packages a repo
running [the mutation lane](docs/gates/mutation-lane.md) declares and knip would
otherwise report as unused. A repo that runs the lane spreads it into its own
`ignoreDependencies`; the names live in one place and the spread stays per-repo,
because `treatConfigHintsAsErrors` makes an ignore matching no declared
dependency an error — carrying it in the base would fail knip in every repo that
does not run the lane.

## Tests and coverage

`bunfig.toml` cannot be extended across packages, so this block is copied into
each repo:

```toml
[test]
coverageThreshold = { lines = 0.75, functions = 0.75 }
coverageSkipTestFiles = true
```

The threshold is declared here and applied by the `--coverage` the
[test-suite](docs/gates/test-suite.md) action passes — which is also why
`[test] coverage` in a repo's own bunfig is refused rather than merely
unnecessary — either spelling, since `false` vetoes CI's flag outright; that
page has the argument.

The CI run exits non-zero below the threshold, which is what makes it a gate
rather than a report. Two properties of it cost a probe to discover: the breach
is not printed — a run that reports every test passing and still exits 1 is
this — and the threshold is applied to **every file**, not to the total. So the
floor goes below the least-covered file, and a repo whose summary line reads 86%
can still be failing on one file at 64%.

0.75 is a floor, not a target: it is set at or below what the repo already
covers, and it is raised only after the coverage is there. A floor above current
reality is a red CI run that teaches everyone to ignore red CI runs.

What coverage cannot say is whether the suite would have noticed had the line
been wrong. [The mutation lane](docs/gates/mutation-lane.md) asks that, over the
domain files a branch changed, and `mutation-floor` is the same paragraph again
for the number it publishes.

## Renovate

`default.json` at this repo's root is a shareable preset. Consuming repos are one
line:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://docs.renovatebot.com/renovate-schema.json",
  "extends": ["github>zerefukun/dev-config"]
}
```

The preset runs weekly, holds every release for 7 days, groups patch, minor, pin
and digest updates into one automerging PR, opens majors as plain PRs to read,
keeps lockfile maintenance on, and pins GitHub Action digests.

Two families move as a unit rather than as packages. Every `expo*`,
`@expo/*` and `react-native*` pin belongs to one Expo SDK release, and a partial
bump builds and then fails on a device, so they group into one "Expo SDK" PR that
is never automerged. `better-auth` and its `@better-auth/*` plugins are versioned
in lockstep, and a plugin ahead of its core fails at import.

The file is named `default.json` because that is the name Renovate resolves for a
bare `github>owner/repo`; `renovate.json` as a preset name is deprecated.

This repo consumes its own preset: the `renovate.json` beside `default.json` is
the one line above, so the policy the fleet inherits is the policy this repo is
held to. The two files are not the same subject — `default.json` is what other
repos extend, `renovate.json` is this repo extending it.

### The pinned-binary custom manager

Every other pin in these repos sits somewhere a manager already looks. A released
binary pinned by tag and archive checksum sits in a `run:` block, which no
built-in manager reads, so the preset adds a `customManagers` entry — one entry
for every tool pinned this way, because the dependency names itself in a comment
directly above the pair:

```json
{
  "customType": "regex",
  "managerFilePatterns": [
    "/^\\.github/workflows/[^/]+\\.ya?ml$/",
    "/^\\.github/actions/[^/]+/action\\.ya?ml$/",
    "/^\\.github/actions/_lib/[^/]+\\.sh$/"
  ],
  "matchStrings": [
    "# renovate: datasource=(?<datasource>\\S+) depName=(?<depName>\\S+)\\s+\\w+_VERSION[:=] ?(?<currentValue>v\\S+)\\s+\\w+_SHA256[:=] ?(?<currentDigest>[0-9a-f]{64})"
  ]
}
```

```yaml
env:
  # renovate: datasource=github-release-attachments depName=owner/tool
  TOOL_VERSION: v1.2.3
  TOOL_SHA256: <sha256 of the release archive>
```

A tool more than one caller needs is fetched by a shell library under
`.github/actions/_lib/` instead, and the pin goes there — beside the fetch, so
it is written once however many callers there are. The one manager reads a shell
assignment as readily as a YAML key:

```sh
# renovate: datasource=github-release-attachments depName=owner/tool
TOOL_VERSION=v1.2.3
TOOL_SHA256=<sha256 of the release archive>
```

Two live ones sit there. `_lib/k6.sh`: db-gate's ramp, this repo's own execution
of the shipped script, and `project-template`'s ramp against a preview stack are
three callers of one pin, and a ramp is only comparable with another ramp of the
same k6. `_lib/shellcheck.sh`: the `shell-scripts` gate over a repo's tracked
scripts, and this repo's own pass over the scripts inlined in its composite
actions — and what the pin buys is
[docs/gates/shell-scripts.md](docs/gates/shell-scripts.md)'s "Which shellcheck".

The shape above is illustrative on purpose: this file is not in the manager's
patterns, so a real version and checksum written here would be the one pin
nobody moves. The live ones sit in `.github/actions/secret-scan/action.yml`,
`.github/actions/lint-workflows/action.yml`, `.github/actions/_lib/k6.sh` and
`.github/actions/_lib/shellcheck.sh` — all of which the patterns cover, and they
cover the next tool without touching the preset.

One pin does live in this README and is managed: the `GITLEAKS_VERSION=` line in
the local install snippet below, which carries no checksum and has a second,
tiny manager of its own.

The datasource is what makes this safe. `github-releases` would move the version
and leave the checksum, and a version bumped past a stale `sha256sum -c` fails
every CI run until someone hashes the archive by hand.
`github-release-attachments` instead searches the current release for the file
the current checksum belongs to — matching the line in `*_checksums.txt` — then
reads the same file's line out of the new release's checksums file. The version
and the checksum are one dependency with one `replaceString` spanning all three
lines, so they cannot land apart.

Finding the release means `currentValue` has to be a tag: a bare `8.30.1` is a
404 on `releases/tags/`, which drops the update. So the pin is written `v8.30.1`
and the URL strips the prefix for the asset name.

### Gating this repo

This repo runs its own gates on itself, from the working tree — a gate its
author's repo cannot pass is a gate nobody should be asked to — and then
typechecks, lints, formats and tests the code that implements them, parses every
JSON file, validates the preset, checks the Lighthouse budget, and lints the half
of it that executes.

Three contract facts are exempted in `ci.yml`, each structural: the configs
inherit from this repo's own bases by relative path because a package cannot
extend itself by name, CI is that file rather than a call into `check.yml`
because a commit cannot pin its own SHA, and there is no runtime environment to
shape.

The gates are TypeScript under `.github/actions/*/`, and `bun test` is what
proves each one refuses a violating tree and passes a clean one — the suites
build a real git repository per case, because the gates ask git what is tracked
and what is ignored. Every other repo's gate is only as honest as those two
lanes, which is why they run first.

The replay suite needs a real Postgres, since what it asserts is what two
databases end up holding. CI publishes one as a service on 5432, which is where
the suite looks unless `TEST_DATABASE_URL` says otherwise; locally that is

```sh
docker run --rm -d -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres postgres:16-alpine
```

It creates and drops databases on whatever it is pointed at, so point it at a
throwaway. Two runs may share one: every name either the suite or a gate puts on
that server carries what tells the runs apart — the process for the suite's own
databases, and the checkout being worked on for the two a gate builds for itself
(`upgrade_path_<digest>` and `backfill_<digest>`).

The limiter conformance suite needs a Redis, since what it grades is a bucket
shared by two processes and a limiter whose Redis is gone. It **flushes** what it
is given, so unlike the Postgres above it has no default at all: `TEST_REDIS_URL`
is required and the suite refuses to guess. A default address is how a suite
wipes the Redis four stacks on one box were sharing.

```sh
docker run --rm -d -p 6390:6379 redis:7-alpine
export TEST_REDIS_URL=redis://127.0.0.1:6390
```

The invariant sweep's suite drives a real browser against a real server, because
every part of what that fixture claims is a browser fact. It needs Playwright's
chromium, which CI installs and a machine gets with:

```sh
bunx playwright install --with-deps chromium-headless-shell
```

The test-suite gate's own suite needs passwordless `sudo`, which is what taking a
network namespace costs — a runner has it, and a machine that does not cannot run
that suite honestly. It is the one gate here whose subject is not a module, so
its cases extract the step out of the shipped `action.yml` and drive it over test
suites of their own.

The linting is the `lint-workflows` action — actionlint, pinned by version and
archive checksum exactly like gitleaks, with shellcheck over every `run:` block.
It runs here from the working tree, and `check.yml` runs it for every consuming
repo, so a scaffolded repo's own workflows are held to the same schema and the
same pins as this one's.

actionlint only understands workflows: handed an `action.yml` it reports a
workflow with no `jobs`. So the composites get a pass of their own, asserting
what silently breaks them — a `run` step with no `shell` never runs the script
it carries — and the scripts inlined in them go through the pinned shellcheck,
with `--shell=bash` because an extracted `run:` block has no shebang. The shell
libraries those blocks source are not extracted from anything, and are read by
the `shell-scripts` gate along with every other `*.sh` in the tree.

actionlint is also silent on a floating tag, so the action carries a second step
that reads every `uses:` in the workflows, in the composite actions, and in
`extra-paths`, and fails anything whose ref is not a 40-character commit SHA. A
tag is a name its owner can repoint at any commit, including after the version
was read here. Only a local `./…` reference is skipped, because it is this
repo's own tree at this commit and has no ref to pin.

The images a job runs are read the same way: a `docker://` action, a job's
`container:` in either spelling, every `services.*.image`, and the `runs.image`
of a Docker container action. Each is held to the digest rule — `@sha256:` and
not a tag — since an image is as much of a dependency as an action is, and its
tag moves whenever it is repushed. An action's `runs.image` that names a
`Dockerfile` is skipped: that is a build from this tree at this commit, with no
registry reference to pin.

There is no standalone `renovate-config-validator` package on npm; the binary
ships inside `renovate`:

```sh
npx --package renovate renovate-config-validator --strict --no-global default.json
```

`--no-global` is load-bearing. Handed a filename the validator assumes
self-hosted global configuration, and in that mode a global-only option like
`binarySource` validates clean — in a shared preset every repo extending it
would drop the option on the floor. `--strict` makes warnings and a pending
config migration exit non-zero rather than print.

## Secret scanning

`gitleaks` guards both ends: a pre-commit hook so a key never reaches a commit,
and a CI step so nothing slips through a push that skipped the hooks.

It is a Go binary, not an npm package, so it installs outside the lockfile:

```sh
GITLEAKS_VERSION=v8.30.1
curl -sSfL "https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/releases/download/${GITLEAKS_VERSION}/gitleaks_${GITLEAKS_VERSION#v}_linux_x64.tar.gz" \
  | tar -xz -C ~/.local/bin gitleaks
```

The hook goes in `lefthook.yml`:

```yaml
pre-commit:
  commands:
    secrets:
      run: gitleaks git --staged --redact --no-banner .
```

`--staged` scans the index rather than the working tree, which is the whole
point: every one of these repos keeps a real `.env` gitignored in its working
tree, so a working-tree scan would fail every commit over secrets that were never
going anywhere. The command deliberately carries no `glob` — a leaked key is as
likely in a `.yml`, a fixture or a `.env` as in a `.ts`. `--redact` keeps the
secret out of the hook output and the CI log; a leak printed by CI is already
readable by anyone who can see the run.

The default rule set is what runs — there is no `gitleaks.toml` here. Scanned
across these repos it reports zero false positives on tracked files, so a shared
allowlist would be configuration guarding a problem that does not exist. A real
false positive is pinned by its fingerprint in a repo-local `.gitleaksignore`,
which keeps the exception next to the file that earned it instead of loosening a
rule for every repo at once.

Two properties of the default rules cost a probe to discover. Keys from providers
with no dedicated rule are caught by the entropy-based `generic-api-key` rule
rather than a named one — that is what matches `RESEND_API_KEY=re_…`. And the AWS
documentation key `AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE` is allowlisted upstream, so testing the
hook with it reports nothing and looks exactly like a broken hook.

## CI

The gate is a workflow in this repo — `.github/workflows/check.yml` — and repos
call it instead of retyping it. A consuming repo's `.github/workflows/ci.yml` is
the whole of its CI:

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:

permissions:
  contents: read

concurrency:
  group: ci-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  check:
    uses: zerefukun/dev-config/.github/workflows/check.yml@<commit sha> # <release tag>
    with:
      build: true
      database: postgres
```

Both evidence names default to a constant, and an artifact name may be claimed
once per run — so a caller that runs `check.yml` as a **matrix** has to give each
leg its own `db-gate-evidence` and `test-suite-evidence`, or the second leg to
upload fails on the duplicate. The two have to differ from each other as well as
between legs: one value used for both hands a single leg's static and database
jobs the same artifact name, which is the same collision one job later. Prefix
with the input's own name — `db-gate-evidence-<leg>` — and both are covered.

The defaults are constants deliberately: the alternative is deriving them from
the matrix index, which GitHub does not
document as reachable from inside a composite action, and a context that is not
reachable evaluates to an empty string rather than to an error — so the derived
name would collide exactly as quietly as the constant, with a trailing dash.

`affected` is the seam turbo needs from a workflow that runs a repo's root
scripts by name. `--affected` is a CLI flag with no environment form, so a
monorepo whose `typecheck` is `turbo run typecheck` has nowhere else to say it.
The flag goes on **pull requests only**: on a push to `main` it diffs `main`
against itself and selects zero packages, and a change to a root file no
package's `inputs` name selects zero as well — so every lane would go green over
nothing. The full run on `main` is what makes handing it to a pull request safe
at all.

Two variables carry it, and the second is not optional. `TURBO_AFFECTED` is the
flag; `TURBO_SCM_BASE` is the commit it narrows against, set to
`github.event.pull_request.base.sha`. Without it the flag narrows nothing:
`actions/checkout` leaves a detached HEAD carrying `refs/remotes/origin/*` and
no local branch, so turbo resolving its base by ref name finds none, prints
"unable to detect git range, assuming all files have changed", and runs the
whole graph — green, and silent about having ignored the flag.

Only `typecheck` narrows. `build` does not, even with `affected: true`: a build
is what writes the generated sources the whole-repo lanes then read — a route
tree, a codegen client — and a build over the changed packages alone leaves
`lint`, `knip` and the root typecheck reading files nothing wrote this run.

A repo with no `turbo.json` is refused rather than handed the flag, since
without turbo it arrives at `tsc`. That check is the file, not the script: a
repo that has a `turbo.json` and a `typecheck` that is still `tsc --noEmit` gets
`--affected` passed to `tsc`, which fails with TS5023 — loudly, which is the
better half of a wrong answer, but a wrong answer.

`TURBO_TELEMETRY_DISABLED` needs no input. It is set in this workflow's own
`env:`, which is the only place a called workflow can be given one: `env:` is
not a permitted key on a job that `uses:` a reusable workflow, and a caller's
workflow-level `env` does not reach the workflow it calls. A scaffolded
monorepo's `.env` covers a checkout and nothing else, so without this every CI
run of every one of them was reporting usage counts.

Eleven inputs are aimed at steps of the database job — `upgrade-gate`,
`semantic-fixtures`, `capacity-path`, `capacity-script`, `db-gate-evidence`,
`route-allowlist`, `timestamp-allowlist`, `backfill-seed`, `backfill-command`,
`probe-command` and `probe-timeout` — and each fails the run when passed with
anything but `database: postgres`, saying which: being quietly ignored is how a
ramp somebody asked for turns out never to have run. `external` refuses them
exactly as `none` does, because the job they configure does not run here either
way — the wrapper that took that job over declares its own. Two of them ride on another input rather
than on the job, and are asked a second question for the same reason:
`semantic-fixtures` is refused without `upgrade-gate: true`, since the rows go
into the replay that input adds, and `probe-timeout` is refused without
`probe-command`, since on its own it bounds nothing. `mutation-floor` is refused
without `mutation-lane: true` on the same argument.

The call is pinned by commit SHA with the release as the trailing comment — the
same contract the actions inside it carry, and the reason a change here reaches
a repo when its pin moves and not before. The example above is deliberately not
a real SHA: nothing keeps a README snippet current, so the pin worth copying is
the live one in `project-template`'s `setup/ci.single.yml` or
`setup/ci.monorepo.yml`. Renovate's github-actions manager
reads a job-level `uses:` exactly as it reads a step's, so the pin moves in a PR
like any other dependency.

`semantic-fixtures` is the one input here that grades **data** rather than
shape. Everything else the database job does is a comparison of schemas, of
column types, of route tables or of rows either side of one command — and a
migration that converges on the right schema while rewriting what a value means
passes every one of them. The fixtures are the rows a deployed database already
holds, replayed through the base ref's migrations and then this branch's, with
the repo's own assertions asking what they now say; `probe-command` is the same
question asked of the booted app's answers rather than of its tables.
[docs/gates/upgrade-path.md](docs/gates/upgrade-path.md) and
[docs/gates/db-gate.md](docs/gates/db-gate.md) carry both, including what neither
can see.

In order, the pinned workflow runs the gitleaks scan, the declarative gates
(repo contract, stack denylist, suppression hygiene, shellcheck over the repo's
own scripts, and the compose lint when asked), `bun install`, the optional build,
`format:check`, `lint`, `typecheck`, `knip`, the test suite, the assertion that
the suite ran, and — where the repo asks for it — the mutation lane over the
domain files this branch changed.
Everything from
`format:check` to the test suite is the local `bun run check`, so a green
pre-push is a green CI run; the rest is what only CI has.

The declarative gates come before `bun install` deliberately. They read the tree
as committed, so a repo that has drifted out of the contract says so in seconds
rather than after a full dependency resolution.

The steps that are shell or a script rather than a `bun run` live in
`.github/actions/` as composite actions — `secret-scan`, `repo-contract`,
`stack-gate`, `suppression-hygiene`, `shell-scripts`, `compose-lint`,
`test-suite`, `db-gate`, `lint-workflows` — so the workflow above and any
repo that has to run the same thing outside it share one copy.
`check.yml` references them by full path and SHA rather than `./`: inside a
called workflow a relative `uses:` resolves against the _caller's_ checkout, and
the alternative — checking this repo out into the caller's workspace — puts its
files under the caller's linter, which is a real failure and not a theoretical
one. Renovate reads the self-reference like any other action pin and keeps it
current.

The matching scripts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "format": "oxfmt",
    "format:check": "oxfmt --check",
    "lint": "oxlint --report-unused-disable-directives-severity=error",
    "typecheck": "tsc --noEmit",
    "knip": "knip",
    "check": "bun run format:check && bun run lint && bun run typecheck && bun run knip"
  }
}
```

Everything the workflow reaches for is pinned by content, not by a name someone
else can repoint: actions and the workflow call by commit SHA, the gitleaks
archive by SHA-256, the Postgres and Redis service images by digest. The tag in
the trailing comment — or beside the digest, for the images — is the label and
the hash is the contract; Renovate moves both together. Service images are
written `postgres:16-alpine@sha256:…` rather than digest-only because that is
the form its docker datasource maintains, and the manager reads a job's
`services:` block for exactly this.

The secret scan downloads the released binary instead of using
`gitleaks/gitleaks-action`, which since v2 is not open source: it ships under a
Gitleaks LLC EULA that requires a license key for repositories owned by an
organization and enforces that requirement in the action itself. The pipeline
would keep working right up to the day one of these repos moved under an org.
The CLI it wraps is MIT, so running it directly sheds the licence question
entirely and puts the scanning version in the diff rather than inside a
third-party action's bundled `dist/`. `GITLEAKS_SHA256` is the same contract the
digest pins are — the version string beside it is the label, and the preset's
pinned-binary manager moves the two in one PR.

The fetch behind it retries, and fetches each pin once per job. A release CDN
resets a connection now and then — this pipeline has taken one — and that is a
retry rather than a supply-chain event; the checksum is still what decides
whether what arrived is the pinned artefact, however many attempts it took. A
job with two callers for one tool downloads it once: the second finds a receipt
naming the checksum already verified, and a caller asking for a different pin
fetches again. A fetch that dies part-way takes the receipt with it, so the next
caller re-fetches rather than trusting a claim about a tool that is not there.

`fetch-depth: 0` is what makes the scan worth running. `gitleaks git` reads
history, and the default shallow checkout hands it exactly one commit — a secret
committed and then deleted further along the same branch would go unreported,
even though pushing it had already burned the key. A full-history scan costs
about a second on repos this size. Since the checkout belongs to the caller and
the scan does not, the action asks git whether the clone is shallow and fails
with that instruction rather than scanning one commit and reporting nothing.

`working-directory` defaults to the checkout, which is the whole story for a
repo gating itself. A caller that generates a tree and then gates it — the
template's scaffolder is the one here — points this at that tree as well: a
secret written by a generator is in no commit the checkout's scan will ever
read.

`setup-bun` is given no version input on purpose: with none it reads the repo's
`packageManager` field from `package.json`, so CI and the dev machine never
drift.

A repo whose types depend on generated code that is not committed — a TanStack
route tree, a codegen client — passes `build: true`, since a clean checkout has
none of it and both `tsc` and the type-aware lint rules would report the
generated symbols as missing.

### The suite has to have run

A lane that can silently not run is not a gate, so the test step writes a JUnit
report and the step after it reads the run out of that report. Both ways a suite
disappears are visible there: `test.skipIf(!process.env.TEST_DATABASE_URL)` and
friends report `<skipped/>`, while a test body that returns early on the same
condition reports `assertions="0"`. Without the check, CI stays green while
nothing below the pure-unit layer has executed since whenever the connection
string stopped being set.

The rule the gate enforces is that a test needing infrastructure fails without
it: read the connection string through something that throws, or use an
in-process engine — PGlite — that is always present. `test.todo` counts as
skipped, deliberately. An assertion-free test fails the same step, which the
house testing rules already reject in review and which costs nothing to reject
here.

That last one binds property tests too, and it is the rule worth writing down
because fast-check does not require it: a predicate that returns a boolean
records no assertion, so a property that never actually ran looks identical to
one that passed. Properties assert with `expect` inside the predicate — and
then a suite that silently stopped running is a red build rather than a number
nobody reads.

### Where each gate is written down

`repo-contract`, `stack-gate`, `suppression-hygiene`, `shell-scripts`,
`lint-workflows` and `compose-lint` run in the static job; `db-gate` is the
database job, and the capacity ramp is a step of it. Each has its page under
[`docs/gates/`](docs/gates/), listed in the table at the top of this file.

### Static sites

Static sites add `.github/workflows/lighthouse.yml`, which builds the site and
holds every Lighthouse category at 100:

```yaml
name: Lighthouse

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:

permissions:
  contents: read

concurrency:
  group: lighthouse-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  lighthouse:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 20
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@3d3c42e5aac5ba805825da76410c181273ba90b1 # v7.0.1

      - uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@0c5077e51419868618aeaa5fe8019c62421857d6 # v2.2.0

      - run: bun install --frozen-lockfile
      - run: bun run build

      - uses: treosh/lighthouse-ci-action@3e7e23fb74242897f95c0ba9cabad3d0227b9b18 # 12.6.2
        with:
          configPath: ./node_modules/@zerefukun/dev-config/lighthouserc.json
          uploadArtifacts: true
```

`lighthouserc.json` asserts performance, accessibility, best-practices and SEO at
`minScore: 1` over three runs of `./dist`. A repo that builds somewhere else
copies the file and changes `staticDistDir`.

## Version policy

Dependencies are pinned exactly — no ranges, no carets — and a version is only
adopted once it has been on npm for at least seven days. Both halves are enforced
by `bunfig.toml` in the consuming repos, and again by the Renovate preset:

```toml
[install]
minimumReleaseAge = 604800 # 7 days, in seconds
exact = true
```

`exact`, and not `saveExact`: bun reads the first and ignores the second, so a
repo declaring the second pins nothing while carrying the field that says it
does. Probed as a matched pair on both ends of the range this fleet runs, with
`HOME` neutralised so no user bunfig decides it — `bun add lodash` writes
`4.18.1` under `exact = true` on bun 1.3.11 and 1.4.0, and `^4.18.1` under
`saveExact = true` on both, exactly as declaring neither does. The repo contract
grades the key bun actually reads.

A package published minutes ago cannot be installed, so a compromised release
that is detected and yanked within hours never reaches a lockfile. Upgrades take
the newest version that clears the window, which is why this repo's baseline is
TypeScript 7.0.x rather than a `7.1.0-dev` build.
